# FlowerClassification
In this project I'm going to be using machine learning to identify different flowers.

To do this, I'll be using data from the Kaggle Petals to the Metal: Flower Classification on TPU competition. It consists of a collection of 10,000+ labeled images of 104 different flowers.

For preprocessing the data, I use TensorFlow 2.x. For the machine learning model, I use the pretrained EfficientNetB3 deep learning model.
